# Titanic Survival Prediction System

**Student Name:** Olubadejo Folajuwon  
**Matric Number:** 23CG034128  

## Project Overview
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using a Random Forest Classifier and a Streamlit Web GUI.

## Structural Requirements
- `app.py`: Main application file.
- `model/model_building.ipynb`: Notebook to train and save the model.
- `model/titanic_survival_model.pkl`: The saved model (generated by the notebook).
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Setup & Execution Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt in this directory and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: This strictly installs streamlit>=1.25.0 to avoid compatibility issues with Altair.*

### 2. Train the Model
You must train the model before running the app.
1. Open `model/model_building.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run all cells.
3. Verify that `titanic_survival_model.pkl` has been created inside the `model/` folder.

### 3. Run the Web App
Run the Streamlit application with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the application in your web browser.

## Deployment
For deployment to Streamlit Cloud:
1. Upload this entire folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your GitHub account to Streamlit Cloud.
3. Select the repository and `app.py` as the entry point.
